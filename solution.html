	<p><b><center><font size="7"><font color="purple">Solution of a Differential Equation</font></font></center></b></p>

<p>A function that satisfies the given differential equation is called its solution.</p><p> The solution that contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation is called a <i>general solution</i>.</p> <p>The solution free from arbitrary constants is called a <i>particular solution.</i></p>

<p><b><font size="5">There are two methods to find the solution of the differential equation.</font></b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Separation of variables</li>
    <li>Integrating factor</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b><font size="5"><font color="green">Separation of variables</font></font></b>
			<p> If the equation Mdx + Ndy =0, can be put in the form
    
    $$ f_1(x)dx+f_2(x)dy=0,$$
    
    then it can be immediately solve by integrating each term separately.</p>
    <p>Thus, the solution of the above equation is 
    
        $$ \int f_1(x)dx + \int f_2(y)dy= C  $$</p>
   

   <p> The process of reducing the equation Mdx+Ndy=0 to the form f<sub>1</sub>(x)dx+f<sub>2</sub>(y)dy = 0 is called the <i>Separation of Variables.</i>
</p></li>
<li><b><font size="5"><font color="green">Integrating Factor</font></font></b>

    <p> If a differential equation when multiplied by a factor(a function of x,y) becomes exact, this factor is called an <i>Integrating Factor</i> of the equation. An integrating factor is sometimes shortly written as I. F.</p>
    
   <p> Integrating factors can be obtained by inspection. An equation can have more than one integrating factor.</p></li>
</ul>
