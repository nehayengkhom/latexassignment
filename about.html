<p><b><center><font size="7"><font color="purple">Definition</font></font></center></b></p>
<p>In mathematics, a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives. In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.</p>

<p>Mainly the study of differential equations consists of the study of their solutions (the set of functions that satisfy each equation), and of the properties of their solutions. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without computing them exactly.</p>

<p>Often when a closed-form expression for the solutions is not available, solutions may be approximated numerically using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.</p>

<p><b><center><font size="7"><font color="purple">Order of Differential Equation</font></font></center></b></p>
<p>The order of the differential equation is the order of the highest order derivative present in the equation. Here some examples for different orders of the differential equation are given.</p>
<p> 
	<ul>
		<li> d<sup>2</sup>y/dx<sup>2</sup>+ 2(dy/dx)+y=0. The order is 2.</li>
        <li> dy/dx+y=kt.The order is 1.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b><font size="5"><font color="green">First Order Differential Equation:</font></font></b><p>All the linear equations in the form of derivatives are in the first order.  It has only the first derivative such as
	dy/dx=f(x,y)=y',  where x and y are the two variables and is represented as

$$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)=y'$$</p></li>

	
		<li><b><font size="5"><font color="green">Second Order Differential Equation:</font></font></b><p>The equation which includes the second-order derivative is the second-order differential equation.  It is represented as $$\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{dy}{dx})=\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=f''(x)=y''$$</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><b><center><font size="7"><font color="purple">Degree of Differential Equation</font></font></center></b></p>
	<p>The degree of the differential equation is the power of the highest order derivative, where the original equation is represented in the form of a polynomial equation in derivatives such as y',y",y"'and so on.</p>
	<p>Suppose (d<sup>2</sup>y/dx<sup>2</sup>+2(dy/dx)+y=0 is a differential equation, so the degree of this equation here is 1.</p>

<p>Let f(x,y,c<sub>1</sub>)=0.....(1)
 be and equation containing x,y and one arbitrary constant c<sub>1</sub>.</p>
 <p>Differentiating (1), we get</p>
 
    $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx}=0 \cdots(2)$$
 
 <p>Equation(2) will, in general, contain c<sub>1</sub>. If c<sub>1</sub> be eliminated between (1) and (2), we shall get a relation involving  x,y and dy/dx, which will evidently be a differential equation of the first order.</p>
 
 <p>Similarly, if we have an equation</p>
 
  $$f(x,y,c_1,c_2)=0 \cdots(3)$$ 
   
   <p>containing two arbitrary constants c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub>, then by differentiating this twice we shall get two equations.</p>
   
   <p>Now, between these two equations and the given equation, in all three equations, if the two arbitrary constants c<sub>1</sub> and  c<sub>2</sub> be eliminated, we shall evidently get a differential equation of the second order.</p>

   <p>In general, if we have an equation</p>
   
     $$f(x,y,c_1,c_2,...,c_n)=0 \cdots(4)$$
   
   <p>containing n arbitrary constants c<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>,......,c<sub>n</sub> then by differentiating this n times we shall get n equations. Now, between these n equations and the given equation, in all (n+1) equations, if the n arbitrary constants c<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>,......,c<sub>n</sub> be eliminated, we shall evidently get a differential equation of the n<sup>th</sup> order<sup>*</sup>, for there being n differentiations the resulting equation must contain a derivative of the n<sup>th</sup> order.

  <p><center><b><font size="7"><font color="purple">Geometrical interpretation</font></font></b></center></p>
   <p>From the process of forming a differential equation from a given primitive, it is clear that since the equation obtained by varying the arbitrary constants in the primitive represents a certain system or family of curves, the differential equation (in which the constants do not appear) expresses some properties common to all those curves. We may thus say that a differential equation represents a family of curves all satisfying some common properties. This can be considerd as the geometrical interpretation of the differential equation.</p>
