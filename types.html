<body><p><b><center><font size="7"><font color="purple">Types of Differential Equation</font></font></center></b></p>
	<p><b>Differential Equation can be divided into several types namely:</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Ordinary Differential Equations</li>
     <li>Partial Differential Equations</li>
     <li>Linear Differential Equations</li>
     <li>Nonlinear Differential Equations</li>
     <li>Homogeneous Differential Equations</li>
     <li>Nonhomogeneous Differential Equations</li>
 </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><b><font size="5">Ordinary Differential Equations:</font></b>
An ordinary differential equation involves function and its derivatives. It contains only one independent variable and one or more of its derivatives with respect to the variable.

The order of ordinary differential equations is defined as the order of the highest derivative that occurs in the equation. The general form of n<sup>th</sup> order ODE is given as

$$F(x, y, y',…., y_n )=0 $$</li>

<li><b><font size="5">Partial Differential Equations:</font></b> 
A Partial Differential Equation commonly denoted as PDE is a differential equation containing partial derivatives of the dependent variable (one or more) with more than one independent variable. A PDE for a function u(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,……x<sub>n</sub>)is an equation of the form


    $$ f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n;u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1},...,\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_n},...\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n};...)=0$$</li>

<li><b><font size="5">Linear Differential Equations:</font></b> 

A linear equation or polynomial, with one or more terms, consisting of the derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to one or more independent variables is known as a linear differential equation.


A general first-order differential equation is given by the expression:

 $$\frac{dy}{dx}+ Py = Q$$ where y is a function and dy/dx is a derivative.

The solution of the linear differential equation produces the value of variable y.

 </li>

 <li><b><font size="5">Nonlinear Differential Equations:</font></b>

When an equation is not linear in unknown function and its derivatives, then it is said to be a nonlinear differential equation.</li>

<li>
	<b><font size="5">Homogeneous Equation:</font></b>
    If M and N of the equation Mdx + Ndy=0 are both of the same degree in x and y and are homogeneous, the equation is said to be <i>homogeneous</i>.
    Such an equation can be put in the form
    $$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(\frac{y}{x}).$$
    Every homogeneous equation of the above type can be easily solved by putting y=vx where v is a function of x, and consequently dy/dx=v+x(dv/dx)=f(v) whereby it reduces to the form v+x(dv/dx)=f(v),i.e., $$ \frac{dx}{x}= \frac{dv}{f(v)-v}$$ in which the variables are seperable.

    <p><b> <font color="green">A Special Form.</font> </b></p>
    <p><FONT COLOR="BLACK"/>The equation of the form $$ \frac{dy}{dx}= \frac{a_1x+b_1y+c_1}{a_2x+b_2y+c_2};( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \neq \frac{b_1}{b_2}) \cdots (1)$$
    can be easily solved by putting x=x'+h and y= y'+k, where h and k are constants, so that dx/dx' and dy/dy' and choosing h,k in such a way that, terms indepedent of x,y in both numerator and denominator becomes 
    $$a_1h+b_1k+c_1=0$$
    $$a_2h+b_2k+c_2=0 \cdots(2)$$ 
    For, now the equation reduces to form 
    $$ \frac{dy'}{dx'}= \frac{a_1x'+b_1y'}{a_2x'+b_2y'} ,$$
    which is homogeneous in x' and y' and hence solvable by the method of the previous article.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE 1:</b> The above method obviously fails, a<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub>=b<sub>1</sub>/b<sub>2</sub>; in this case h and k cannot be determined from equation (2).</p>

   <p><b>NOTE 2:</b> If the equation (1),a<sub>2</sub>=-b<sub>2</sub> then the equation can be solved more easily by grouping the terms suitably.</p>
</li>
<li><b><font size="5">Exact Equation:</font></b>
    The differential equation Mdx + Ndy=0, where both M and N are functions of x and y, is said to be exact when there is a function u of x,y, such that Mdx + Ndy= du, i.e., when Mdx + Ndy becomes a <i>perfect differential.</i>
    
    <p>Now, we know from Differential Calculus that Mdx +Ndy should be a perfect differential if $$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}.$$
    Hence, the condition that Mdx +Ndy=0 should be an <i>exact differential equation</i> is $$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}= \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}.$$</p>

    <p>The method of solving an exact equation of the type Mdx +Ndy=0 is as follows:</p>
    
    <p><i>First integrate the terms in Mdx as if y were constant, then integrate the terms in N dy considering x as constant, and, rejecting the terms already obtained, equate the sum of these integrals to a constant.</i></p>
    
    <p>This will be the solution of the required equation.</p>
	
</li>
<li><b><font size="5">Linear Equation:</font></b>
    An equation of the form
    $$ \frac{dy}{dx}+Py=Q$$
    in which P and Q are functions of x alone or constants is called a linear equation of the first order.

    <p>The general solution of the above equation can be found as follows.</p>
    <p>Multiply both sides of the equation by $$ e^{\int Pdx}.$$
    $$\therefore \frac{dy}{dx}  e^{\int Pdx}+Py e^{\int Pdx} = Qe^{\int Pdx},$$
    ie.,$$\frac{d}{dx}(y e^{\int Pdx})=Q e^{\int Pdx}$$
    integrating,
    $$ye^{\int Pdx} = \int Q e^{\int P dx}dx + C,$$
    or, $$y= e^{-\int {P dx}} [\int Q e^{\int P dx}dx + C]$$ is the required solution.</p>

    <p><b><font color="green">Cor.1.</b></font>If in the above equation Q is zero, the general solution is $$ y= C e^{-\int Pdx}.$$</p>

    <p><b><font color="green">Cor.2.</b></font>If P be a constant and equals to -m, then the solution is
    $$ y= e^{mx}[\int e^{-mx} Qdx+ C].$$</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Here the factor $$e^{-\int Pdx},$$ which renders the left hand member of the equation a perfect differential, is called Integrating Factor.</p>
